THE SURROUNDING CAPSULE OF STREPTOCOCCUS PNEUMONIAE HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS A MAJOR VIRULENCE FACTOR AND IS TARGETED BY PNEUMOCOCCAL CONJUGATE VACCINES (PCV). HOWEVER, NONENCAPSULATED S. PNEUMONIAE (NON-EC-SP) HAVE ALSO BEEN ISOLATED GLOBALLY, MAINLY IN CARRIAGE STUDIES. IT IS UNKNOWN IF NON-EC-SP EVOLVE SPORADICALLY, IF THEY HAVE HIGH ANTIBIOTIC NONSUSCEPTIBLITY RATES AND A UNIQUE, SPECIFIC GENE CONTENT. HERE, WHOLE-GENOME SEQUENCING OF 131 NON-EC-SP ISOLATES SOURCED FROM 17 DIFFERENT LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD WAS PERFORMED. RESULTS REVEALED A DEEP-BRANCHING CLASSIC LINEAGE THAT IS DISTINCT FROM MULTIPLE SPORADIC LINEAGES. THE SPORADIC LINEAGES CLUSTERED WITH A PREVIOUSLY SEQUENCED, GLOBAL COLLECTION OF ENCAPSULATED S. PNEUMONIAE (EC-SP) ISOLATES WHILE THE CLASSIC LINEAGE IS COMPRISED MAINLY OF THE FREQUENTLY IDENTIFIED MULTILOCUS SEQUENCES TYPES (STS) ST344 (N = 39) AND ST448 (N = 40). ALL ST344 AND NINE ST448 ISOLATES HAD HIGH NONSUSCEPTIBLITY RATES TO ?-LACTAMS AND OTHER ANTIMICROBIALS. ANALYSIS OF THE ACCESSORY GENOME REVEALS THAT THE CLASSIC NON-EC-SP CONTAINED AN INCREASED NUMBER OF MOBILE ELEMENTS, THAN EC-SP AND SPORADIC NON-EC-SP.

HAS EMERGED AS A SIGNIFICANT PATHOGEN CAUSING NOSOCOMIAL INFECTIONS. TREATMENT OF THESE PATHOGENS HAS BECOME A MAJOR CHALLENGE TO ALL CLINICIANS WORLDWIDE. HUGE REVENUE AND TECHNOLOGY IS ALSO BEING DEDICATED TOWARDS DEVELOPING NOVEL DRUGS AND ANTIBIOTIC COMBINATIONS TO COMBAT RESISTANCE. ADDRESSING THE ABOVE ISSUE, WE HAVE CONSTRUCTED A PANEL OF STRAINS OF ACINETOBACTER SP. EXPRESSING DIFFERENT RESISTANCES SUCH AS NARROW SPECTRUM Β-LACTAMASE AND OXACILLINASE, ESBL, OXA-CARBAPENEMASE, MBL AND OVER PRODUCING AMPC, AND GENOTYPICALLY CHARACTERIZED THEM TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RESISTANCE MECHANISM.METHODSALL THE BACTERIAL STRAINS EXHIBITING DIFFERENT RESISTANCE PHENOTYPES WERE COLLECTED ACCORDING TO THE DIAGNOSTIC DECISION TREE BASED ON PHENOTYPIC OBSERVATION MENTIONED IN COURVALIN, P., ET AL. ANTIBIOGRAM, DURING THE PERIOD 2008-2013 FROM SEVERANCE HOSPITAL, SEOUL. ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY WAS DETERMINED ACCORDING TO THE CLSI GUIDELINES USING AGAR DILUTION METHOD. SELECTED STRAINS WERE SEQUENCED USING ION TORRENT PGM SYSTEM, ANNOTATED USING RAST SERVER AND ANALYZED USING GENEIOUS PRO 8.0.RESULTSGENOTYPIC DETERMINANTS I.E. ACQUIRED RESISTANCE GENES, MUTATIONS AND PORIN ALTERNATIONS CONTRIBUTING TO THE RELEVANT EXPRESSED PHENOTYPE WAS CHARACTERIZED USING MASSIVE PARALLEL TECHNOLOGY. THE COMPLETE RESISTANCE MECHANISMS FOR THE COLLECTED REFERENCE STRAINS WERE DETERMINED. DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF MULTIPLE RESISTANCE GENES AND TRANSPOSONS, THE DIAGNOSTIC DECISION TREE FOR EVALUATING THE RESISTANCE IS NOT ACCURATE, WHICH ALARMS THE URGENT NEED FOR MODIFICATION TO THIS SCHEME.CONCLUSIONTHE COMPLETE ILLUSTRATED MECHANISM CONTRIBUTING TO SPECIFIC RESISTANCE PHENOTYPES CAN BE USED AS A TARGET FOR THE NOVEL DRUG DEVELOPMENT. THESE STRAINS CAN BE USED AS A REFERENCE STRAIN IN THE CLINICAL LABORATORY AND ALSO IN EVALUATING THE ANTI-MICROBIAL DRUG EFFICIENCY FOR SPECIFIC RESISTANCE. SIMILAR WORK CAN ALSO BE PERFORMED IN OTHER SPECIES/GENUS TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISM AND CONTROL THE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS."

PHASE 2, THE MICROBIAL NUCLEIC ACIDS ARE SEQUENCED AND DE NOVO ASSEMBLED USING ILLUMINA AND PACBIO SEQUENCING PLATFORMS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR GENOME SCIENCES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND (UMD-IGS). PHASE 3, THE ASSEMBLED GENOMES ARE VETTED BY AN ID-NGS SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT WORKING GROUP CONSISTING OF FDA PERSONNEL AND COLLABORATORS AND THE DATA ARE DEPOSITED IN NCBI DATABASES.   THE FDA-ARGOS GENOMES MEET THE QUALITY METRICS FOR REFERENCE-GRADE GENOMES FOR REGULATORY USE. FDA-ARGOS REFERENCE GENOMES HAVE BEEN DE NOVO ASSEMBLED WITH HIGH DEPTH OF BASE COVERAGE AND PLACED WITHIN A PRE-ESTABLISHED PHYLOGENETIC TREE. EACH MICROBIAL ISOLATE IN THE DATABASE IS COVERED AT A MINIMUM OF 20X OVER 95 PERCENT OF THE ASSEMBLED CORE GENOME.

WE USED FERMENTATION CHARACTERISTICS, BIOCHEMICAL ASSAYS AND FATTY ACID PROFILES FOR TAXONOMIC ANALYSIS OF EB-247T, AND SUPPLEMENTED THIS WITH INFORMATION DERIVED FROM SUB-GENOME- AND GENOME- BASED ANALYSIS. PHENOTYPIC AND MORPHOLOGICAL TESTS REVEALED THAT THE ISOLATE IS A GRAM-NEGATIVE, ROD-SHAPED, HIGHLY MOTILE AND FACULTATIVELY ANAEROBIC. WHOLE CELL ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT MOST OF THE FATTY ACIDS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF C17:0 CYCLO AND C16:1Ω6C/C16:1Ω7C THAT WERE PRESENT IN ALTERED RATIOS, WERE TYPICAL FOR THE ENTEROBACTER SPECIES. WE PERFORMED WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING OF EB-247T TO PERFORM SUBGENOME-BASED PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS I.E. 16S RRNA, MULTI-LOCUS SEQUENCE ANALYSIS (MLSA) AND WHOLE-GENOME-BASED TAXONOMIC ANALYSIS. THE DRAFT GENOME OF EB-247T WAS APPROXIMATELY 4.9 MB IN SIZE WITH A G+C CONTENT OF 56.0%. THE 16S RDNA SEQUENCE OF EB-247T SHOWED > 97% SIMILARITY TO ALL THE ENTEROBACTER SPECIES, WHILE MLSA CLUSTERED EB-247T WITHIN ENTEROBACTER BUT CLASSIFIED IT AS A SEPARATE SPECIES. ANALYSIS USING IN SILICO DNA-DNA HYBRIDIZATION SHOWED IT HAD LESS THAN 70% SEQUENCE SIMILARITY WITH OTHER ENTEROBACTER SPECIES. THE AVERAGE NUCLEOTIDE IDENTITY OF EB-247T EXHIBITED LESS THAN 95% SEQUENCE SIMILARITY TO ALL THE COMPARED ENTEROBACTER SPECIES SUPPORTING IT’S A NEW SPECIES. FROM THESE RESULTS, WE CONCLUDE THAT EB-247T POSSESSES SUFFICIENT CHARACTERISTICS THAT ARE DIFFERENT FROM KNOWN ENTEROBACTER SPECIES, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED TO BE A NOVEL SPECIES.
